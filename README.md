# DIY Bluetooth Mono Speaker

## Overview  
This project documents the design and build process of a **DIY Bluetooth Mono Speaker** using vintage components and modern modules.  
The goal is to combine classic analog aesthetics with reliable wireless audio functionality.  

## Objectives  
- Build a compact mono speaker with Bluetooth connectivity  
- Reuse and repurpose old electronic components where possible  
- Improve understanding of PCB design, wiring, and enclosure modification  
- Share knowledge and inspire others to build their own audio devices  

## Features  
- Bluetooth audio input (via standard Bluetooth module)  
- Mono amplifier circuit  
- Vintage-style enclosure  
- Rechargeable power supply  

## Materials Used  
- Bluetooth audio module (e.g., CSR8635/Generic Bluetooth 5.0 module)  
- Mono amplifier board (e.g., TDA2030, PAM8403, or similar)  
- Old speaker driver (repurposed)  
- Vintage radio enclosure (upcycled)  
- Battery pack (Li-ion 18650 with protection circuit)  
- DC charging module (TP4056 or similar)  
- Custom wiring and connectors  

## Build Process  
1. **Planning & Design**  
   - Select enclosure and speaker driver  
   - Draft wiring diagram and component layout  

2. **Disassembly & Preparation**  
   - Clean and prepare the vintage enclosure  
   - Test old components and replace damaged parts  

3. **Assembly**  
   - Install Bluetooth module and amplifier board  
   - Wire speaker driver, battery pack, and charging module  
   - Mount components securely inside the case  

4. **Testing & Tuning**  
   - Verify Bluetooth connectivity  
   - Adjust amplifier gain for clear sound  
   - Test playback time with battery  

## Future Improvements  
- Add volume and tone control  
- Support for AUX input  
- Stereo version with two drivers  
- Improved battery life
